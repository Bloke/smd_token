16-character tokens are default therefore to return a 16-character randomly-generated token:

bc. <txp:smd_token />

Display a 24-character randomly-generated token:

bc. <txp:smd_token length="24" />

Display a 12-character randomly-generated token with a prefix:

bc. <txp:smd_token length="12" prefix="nonce-" />

Outputs something like @nonce-ab1b7f98175e@.
